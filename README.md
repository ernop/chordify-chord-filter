Chordify Chord filterer & sorter
---

Chordify is a cool site.  It has the chords for a ton of songs it's automatically generated by listening to them, from youtube. 

Song pages let you do both 1) hear the song and 2) see the chords being played, so you can play them on a keyboard or whatever.

This works great.

There's one problem: if songs have tons of chords, you will naturally want to review them beforehand.  They ahve they have a good UI for that. But, within the say 20 chords of a song, you may already know most of them and really just want to see the 3 you don't know yet.  This is a pain and isn't supported visually.

How this greasemonkey script fixes it
---

1) you modify a list of chords you know (Am#, ...) etc
2) whenever you visit a chord list page, those are filtered out
3) others are left behind, and they're sorted too

Improvements?

Now, I use this by opening two tabs, one with the chords and the other with the song overview so I can review, then practice and switch back and forth easily.  This works well but maybe there could be an even better UI which combines it all into one? i.e. if the animation view also highlighted *only* the chords which I didn't know yet?

This is my filtered "chord review" UI

This is the default song play & practice view.  The embedded youtube video in the upper right live-plays directly from youtube, relieving the site of burdens, I imagine.
