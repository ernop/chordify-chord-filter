What is this?
---

It's a greasemonkey extension for web browsers, for users of Chordify, which filters and sorts the chords shown on the practice screen to make it more useful as you're learning.

---
Bit of background
---

Chordify is a cool site.  It has the chords for a ton of songs it's automatically generated by listening to them, from youtube. 

The pages for each song let you both 1) hear the song and 2) see the chords being played, so you can play them on a keyboard or whatever.

This works great.

There's one problem: if songs have tons of chords, you will naturally want to review them beforehand.  They have they have a good UI for that. But it shows ALL the chords, which means that you'll know 90% and be searching for the one you want to practice.

Secondly, when searching, the chords are in "appearance order" rather than alphabetical.

---
How this greasemonkey script fixes it
---

1) you modify a list of chords you know (Am#, ...) etc
2) whenever you visit a chord list page, those are filtered out
3) others are left behind, and they're sorted alphabetically

Improvements?
---

Now, I use this by opening two tabs, one with the chords and the other with the song overview so I can review, then practice and switch back and forth easily.  This works well but maybe there could be an even better UI which combines it all into one? i.e. if the animation view also highlighted *only* the chords which I didn't know yet?

This is my filtered "chord review" UI

I'm just starting out, so the only chords I filter out are the basic naturals, flats, and minors. I'm still working on dim/sus/aug, slash chords, plus tons more

Song practice - overview screen

This is unmodified here - just including it for fun.

This is the default song play & practice view.  The embedded youtube video in the upper right live-plays directly from youtube, relieving the site of burdens, I imagine.

My practice songs
---

These are the songs I've started out with.  I was pretty surprised to find out how easy it was to play along with songs and have it sound good.  Compared to classical piano, just jumping to chords is way, way easier.  To the point that you can have tons of fun playing along with songs on day 1.
